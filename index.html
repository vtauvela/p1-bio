			<h2>MAJOR</h2>
				
				<p>Formerly a Developmental Psych major, I switched my major to Visual Communication Design in Fall of 2012 to pursue a career as a graphic designer, print and logo design being my primary focus.</p>

		<div class="grid_4">
			<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
				
				<p>Before attending college, graphic design was not at the forefront of my mind as far as future plans went. Formerly an Applied Psychology major, a deep-seated desire for creative freedom led me to switch to Visual Communication Design in 2012. </p>

				<p>I'm currently finishing up my major in VCD, wrapping up my stay at Eastern in Winter 2015.</p>

				<p>I'm a former illustrator and graphic artist who worked for the college paper, The Easterner. The areas that I tend to do well in include information design and logo design/branding. The areas I'm really trying to focus on is understanding and practicing responsive web design, and overcoming shyness when presenting my work.
